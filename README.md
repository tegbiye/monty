# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
**About:** In this project, I created a simple interpreter for Monty ByteCodes. The interpreter reads a bytecode 
file and executes the bytecode commands.
### The Monty language
Monty is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a 
unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.
### Monty byte code files
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it 
is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can 
be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument
## Compilation & Output
* These codes were compiled using: ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty``` * Any output 
must be printed on ```stdout``` * Any error message must be printed on ```stderr```
## Examples
``` julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m push 0$ push 1$ push 2$ push 3$ pall $ push 4$ push 5 $ push 6 
      $
pall$ julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ ```

## Tasks:

### Mandatory:-

0. push, pall Implement the push and pall opcodes.

1. pint Implement the pint opcode.

2. pop Implement the pop opcode.

3. swap Implement the swap opcode.

4. add Implement the add opcode. Implement the add opcode.

5. nop Implement  the nop opcode.

### Advanced:-
6. sub Implement the sub opcode.

7. div Implement the div opcode.

8. mul Implement the mul opcode.

9. mod Implement the mod opcode.

10. comments When the first non-space character of a line is #, treat this line as a comment (don't do anything).

11. pchar Implement the pchar opcode that prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

12.  pstr Implement the pstr opcode that prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

13. rotl Implement the rotl opcode that rotates the stack to the top.

14. rotr Implement the rotr opcode that rotates the stack to the bottom.

15. stack, queue Implement the stack and queue opcodes. The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO).
This is the default behavior of the program. The opcode queue sets the format of the data to a queue (FIFO).

16. Brainf*ck Write a Brainf*ck script that prints School, followed by a new line. 17. Add two digits Add two digits given by the user.

18. Multiplication Multiply two digits given by the user.

19. Multiplication level up Multiply two digits given by the user.
